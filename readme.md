# Lesson 1 - Class Design

* SRP	The Single Responsibility Principle	A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
* OCP	The Open Closed Principle	You should be able to extend a classes behavior, without modifying it.
* LSP	The Liskov Substitution Principle	Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.
* ISP	The Interface Segregation Principle	Make fine grained interfaces that are client specific.
* DIP	The Dependency Inversion Principle	Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

# Lesson 2 - Component Cohesion

* REP	The Release Reuse Equivalency Principle	The granule of reuse is the granule of release.
* CCP	The Common Closure Principle	Classes that change together are packaged together.
* CRP	The Common Reuse Principle	Classes that are used together are packaged together.

# Lesson 3 - Component Coupling

* ADP	The Acyclic Dependencies Principle	The dependency graph of packages must have no cycles.
* SDP	The Stable Dependencies Principle	Depend in the direction of stability.
* SAP	The Stable Abstractions Principle	Abstractness increases with stability.
